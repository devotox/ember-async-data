// The exported type is the intersection of three narrowed interfaces. Doing it

//
// 1.  It allows narrowing to work. For example:
//
//     ```ts
//     let data = new TrackedAsyncData(Promise.resolve("hello"));
//     if (data.isPending) {
//       data.value;  // null
//       data.error;  // null

//       data.value;  // null
//       data.error;  // null
//     } else if (data.isRejected) {
//       data.value;  // null
//       data.error;  // unknown, can now be narrowed
//     }
//     ```
//
//     This dramatically improves the usability of the type in type-aware
//     contexts (including with templates when using Glint!)
//
// 2.  Using `interface extends` means that (a) it is guaranteed to be a subtype
//     of the `_TrackedAsyncData` type, (b) that the docstrings applied to the
//     base type still work, and (c) that the types which are *common* to the
//     shared implementations (i.e. `.toJSON()` and `.toString()`) are shared
//     automatically.

/**
  An autotracked `Promise` handler, representing asynchronous data.

  Given a `Promise` instance, a `TrackedAsyncData` behaves exactly lik the
  original `Promise`, except that it makes the state of the `Promise` visible
  via tracked state, so you can check whether the promise is pending, resolved,
  or rejected; and so you can get the value if it has resolved or the error if
  it has rejected.

  Every `Promise` in the system is guaranteed to be associated with at most a
  single `TrackedAsyncData`.

  ## Example

  ```ts
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { cached } from '@glimmer/tracking';
  import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
  import TrackedAsyncData from 'ember-async-data/tracked-async-data';

  export default class SmartProfile extends Component<{ id: number }> {
    @service store;

    @cached
    get someData() {
      let recordPromise = this.store.findRecord('user', this.args.id);
      return new TrackedAsyncData(recordPromise, this);
    }

    <template>
      {{#if this.someData.isResolved}}
        <PresentTheData @data={{this.someData.data}} />
      {{else if this.someData.isPending}}
        <LoadingSpinner />
      {{else if this.someData.isRejected}}
        <p>
          Whoops! Looks like something went wrong!
          {{this.someData.error.message}}
        </p>
      {{/endif}}
    </template>
  }
  ```

  data: T | Promise<T>,
  context: {}
